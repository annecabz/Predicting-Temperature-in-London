# Predicting-Temperature-in-London

Use machine learning to predict the mean temperature in London, England, logging your root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics using mlflow.

Build a model to predict "mean_temp" with a RMSE of 3 or less.
Use MLflow to log any models you train, their hyperparameters, and respective RMSE scores (ensuring you include "rmse" as part of the metric name).
Search all of your mlflow runs and store the results as a variable called experiment_results.
