Since the weather depends on a lot of different factors, you will want to run a lot of experiments to determine what the best approach is to predict the weather. In this project, you will run experiments for different regression models predicting the mean temperature, using a combination of `sklearn` and `MLflow`.\n\nYou will be working with data stored in `london_weather.csv`, which contains the following columns:\n- **date** - recorded date of measurement - (**int**)\n- **cloud_cover** - cloud cover measurement in oktas - (**float**)\n- **sunshine** - sunshine measurement in hours (hrs) - (**float**)\n- **global_radiation** - irradiance measurement in Watt per square meter (W/m2) - (**float**)\n- **max_temp** - maximum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **mean_temp** - mean temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **min_temp** - minimum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **precipitation** - precipitation measurement in millimeters (mm) - (**float**)\n- **pressure** - pressure measurement in Pascals (Pa) - (**float**)\n- **snow_depth** - snow depth measurement in centimeters (cm) - (**float**)","metadata":{},"id":"42a0676a-ba47-4e32-93f9-913bb233ed9c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Run this cell to import the modules you require\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport mlflow\nimport mlflow.sklearn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Read in the data\nweather = pd.read_csv(\"london_weather.csv\")\n\n# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you like","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4825,"lastExecutedAt":1738061807936,"lastExecutedByKernel":"d7cc9245-27a6-4912-b3ee-2b54b32adde2","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Run this cell to import the modules you require\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport mlflow\nimport mlflow.sklearn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Read in the data\nweather = pd.read_csv(\"london_weather.csv\")\n\n# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you like"},"id":"4ac85ad4-a7e9-43d0-9dae-b21026e32dfe","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
